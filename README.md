## Install dependencies

1. Navigate to the root directory and `npm install` all dependencies.

2. This app uses dotenv, create a copy of .example-env with your preferred Port and Git Access Token. Rename this to .env since it is on the .gitignore.

3. Also fill your Git Access Token into the config.js file.

4. Lastly `npm start` to run the instance, we have included hot refresh so it is listening for changes.
